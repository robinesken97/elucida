Octet's drug names (`src/drugs.ts`) are Octet's own SMILES checked against PubChem; a few complex ones (tetracyclines, steroids, paclitaxel, strychnine) follow PubChem's SMILES. Sam approved, 18 October 2026. The dictionary's build asks PubChem which compound a shared or doubtful name keeps (no PubChem data is shipped for it), and Name to Structure asks PubChem online (decision 0015).

Notice in `data/names/NOTICE.txt` |

The OPSIN build's notices are in [src/vendor/opsin/NOTICES.txt](src/vendor/opsin/NOTICES.txt). The app ships them as `licences/opsin.txt`.

The app ships every licence notice in `licences/third-party.txt`, which About > Licences opens. `node scripts/licences.mjs`
writes it from the Rust crates and npm packages Octet ships and the files named above (REL-12).
