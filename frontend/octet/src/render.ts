// ACS 1996 structure renderer: a KET molecule in, filled outlines and text runs out. Units are px.
// The geometry follows ChemDraw's ACS 1996 output, measured to about 1e-5 pt on a reference drawing:
// - Every bond line is a filled polygon. At an unlabelled atom the polygons meet in a mitred fan.
// - Bonds stop a margin short of the letter they meet; where that letter changes with the reading direction, short of
//   the label's box. One cut per bond. Between two labels the margin narrows, so the bond shows a third of its length.
// - Ring double bonds keep the axis line and add an inner line, trimmed back to the ring-angle bisector.
// - Terminal double bonds (C=O) are centred and run on until they meet the neighbouring bonds.
// - Labels are anchored on the advance centre and half the ink height of their first glyph. Read right to left,
//   that glyph stays on the atom if the label ends with it (OMe as MeO); if not (Br), the label's ink ends as far
//   right of the atom as it starts left of it read left to right.
